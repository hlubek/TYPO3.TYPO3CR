== Value ==

=== InputStream getStream() ===
Returns an InputStream representation of this value. Uses the 
standard conversion to binary. It is the responsibility of the caller 
to close the returned InputStream. 
If a non-stream get method has previously been called on this 
Value instance, an IllegalStateException is thrown. In this 
case, a new Value instance must be acquired in order to 
successfully call getStream. 
A RepositoryException is thrown if another error occurs. 

=== Calendar getDate() ===
Returns a Calendar representation of this value. 
The object returned is a copy of the stored value, so changes to it 
are not reflected in internal storage. 
If this value cannot be converted to a Calendar, a 
ValueFormatException is thrown. 
If getStream has previously been called on this Value instance, an 
IllegalStateException is thrown. In this case a new Value 
instance must be acquired in order to successfully call 
getDate. 
A RepositoryException is thrown if another error occurs. 

=== int getType() ===
Returns the type of this value. See 4.2.6 Property Types. The type 
returned is that which was set at property creation.
