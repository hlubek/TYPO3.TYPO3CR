== Value ==

=== InputStream getStream() ===
Returns an InputStream representation of this value. Uses the
standard conversion to binary. It is the responsibility of the caller
to close the returned InputStream.
If a non-stream get method has previously been called on this
Value instance, an IllegalStateException is thrown. In this
case, a new Value instance must be acquired in order to
successfully call getStream.
A RepositoryException is thrown if another error occurs.
