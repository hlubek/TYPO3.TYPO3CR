=== void accept(ItemVisitor visitor) ===
Accepts an ItemVisitor and calls the appropriate visit method 
according to whether this Item is a Node or a Property. 
This method provides support for the visitor design pattern. It takes an 
ItemVisitor object that must implement two methods: visit(Node 
node) and visit(Property property). Depending on whether this 
Item is a Node or a Property one of the visit methods is called with this 
Item as the parameter. 
The API also provides the abstract class TraversingItemVisitor 
implementing ItemVisitor, which automatically traverses the hierarchy 
calling accept at each node and property. It provides the methods 
entering and leaving that can be overridden in a subclass to perform 
custom operations. 
Throws a RepositoryException if an error occurs.
