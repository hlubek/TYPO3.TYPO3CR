Node 
setActivity(Node activity) 
This method is called by the client to set the current activity on the 
session. Changing the current activity is done by calling 
setActivity 
again. Cancelling the current activity (so that the session has no current 
activity) is done by calling 
setActivity(null). The activity Node is 
returned.
