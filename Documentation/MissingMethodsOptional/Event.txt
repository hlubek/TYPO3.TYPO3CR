== Event ==

int 
getType() 
Returns the type of this event. A constant defined in this interface. 
String 
getPath() 
Returns the absolute path of the item associated with this event. The 
interpretation given to the returned path depends upon the type of the 
event, see the individual event-type constants below. 
A 
RepositoryException is thrown if an error occurs.  
String 
getSourcePath() 
Returns the absolute source path associated with this event. Only events 
of type 
MOVE, COPY and CLONE have associated source paths. For all other 
event types this method returns an empty string. 
String 
getUserID() 
Returns the user ID connected with this event. This is the string returned 
by 
getUserID of the session that caused the event. 
int NODE_ADDED 
An event of this type is generated when a node is added. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node that was 
added. 
int 
NODE_REMOVED 
An event of this type is generated when a node is removed. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node that was 
removed. 
 
int 
PROPERTY_ADDED 
An event of this type is generated when a property is added. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the property that was 
added. 
 
int 
PROPERTY_REMOVED 
An event of this type is generated when a property is removed. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the property that was 
removed. 
 
int 
PROPERTY_CHANGED 
An event of this type is generated when the value of a property is 
changed. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the property that was 
changed. 
 
int 
SAVE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Session.save or Item.save. 
In the case of a 
Session.save, getPath returns the absolute path of the 
root node, “ 
/”. In the case of Item.save, getPath returns the path of 
the item on which the method was called. 

int 
MOVE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Workspace.move. 
In this case 
getPath returns the destAbsPath parameter and 
getSourcePath returns the srcAbsPath parameter of the move. 

int 
COPY 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Workspace.copy. 
In this case 
getPath returns the destAbsPath parameter and 
getSourcePath returns the srcAbsPath parameter of the copy. 
int 
ADD_MIXIN 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.addMixin if the 
implementation immediately persists mixin changes (some 
implementations persist these changes on 
save, some immediately). 
In this case 
getPath returns the path of the node to which the mixin was 
added. 
int 
REMOVE_MIXIN 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.removeMixin if the 
implementation immediately persists mixin changes (some 
implementations persist these changes on 
save, some immediately). 
In this case 
getPath returns the path of the node from which the mixin 
was removed.. 
int 
CLONE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Workspace.clone. 
In this case 
getPath returns the destAbsPath parameter and 
getSourcePath returns the srcAbsPath parameter of the clone. 
int 
UPDATE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.update. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node on which the 
method was called. 
 
int 
IMPORT 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Workspace.importXML or 
Workspace.getImportContentHandler. 
In this case 
getPath returns the parentAbsPath parameter of the 
import. 
 
int 
CHECKIN 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.checkin. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node on which the 
method was called. 
 
int 
CHECKOUT 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.checkout. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node on which the 
method was called. 
 
int 
RESTORE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.restore, 
Node.restoreByLabel or Workspace.restore. 
In the case of 
Node.restore and Node.restoreByLabel, getPath 
returns the absolute path of the node on which the method was called. In 
the case of 
Workspace.restore, getPath returns the absolute path of 
the root node, “ 
/”. 
int 
MERGE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.merge. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node on which the 
method was called. 
 
int 
CANCEL_MERGE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.cancelMerge. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node on which the 
method was called. 
 
int 
DONE_MERGE 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
Node.doneMerge. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the node on which the 
method was called. 
 
int 
ADD_VERSION_LABEL 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
VersionHistory.addVersionLabel. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the jcr:versionLabels node that was altered. 
int 
REMOVE_VERSION_LABEL 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
VersionHistory.removeVersionLabel. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the 
jcr:versionLabels node that was altered. 
int 
REMOVE_VERSION 
An event of this type is generated upon a 
VersionHistory.removeVersion. 
In this case 
getPath returns the absolute path of the nt:version node 
that was removed. 
 
int
