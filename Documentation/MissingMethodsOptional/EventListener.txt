== EventListener ==

void onEvent(EventIterator event) 
This method is called when a bundle of events is dispatched. See 
6.3.9.1 Event Production. 

== SynchronousEventListener extends EventListener ==

Defines a marker interface for EventListener implementations that 
wish to have a synchronous notification of changes to the workspace. 
That is, a SynchronousEventListener.onEvent method is guaranteed 
to be called before the persisting call returns (a persisting call being call 
to save or one of the immediately persisting methods, see 5.1.1.2 
Writing Directly to the Workspace). In contrast, a regular 
EventListener.onEvent method may be called by the implementation 
after the persisting call returns.  

== EventListenerIterator extends RangeIterator ==
EventListener nextEventListener() 
Returns the next EventListener in the iteration. 
Throws a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the iterator contains 
no more elements.
