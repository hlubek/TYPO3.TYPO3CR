	/**
	 * Completes the merge process with respect to the node at absPath and the
	 * specified version.
	 *
	 * When the merge(string, string, boolean) method is called on a node, every
	 * versionable node in that subgraph is compared with its corresponding node
	 * in the indicated other workspace and a "merge test result" is determined
	 * indicating one of the following:
	 *
	 * 1. This node will be updated to the state of its correspondee (if the base
	 *    version of the correspondee is more recent in terms of version history)
	 * 2. This node will be left alone (if this node's base version is more recent
	 *    in terms of version history).
	 * 3. This node will be marked as having failed the merge test (if this node's
	 *    base version is on a different branch of the version history from the
	 *    base version of its corresponding node in the other workspace, thus
	 *    preventing an automatic determination of which is more recent).
	 *
	 * (See merge(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, boolean) for more details)
	 *
	 * In the last case the merge of the non-versionable subgraph (the "content")
	 * of this node must be done by the application (for example, by providing a
	 * merge tool for the user).
	 *
	 * Additionally, once the content of the nodes has been merged, their version
	 * graph branches must also be merged. The JCR versioning system provides for
	 * this by keeping a record, for each versionable node that fails the merge
	 * test, of the base version of the corresponding node that caused the merge
	 * failure. This record is kept in the jcr:mergeFailed property of this node.
	 * After a merge, this property will contain one or more (if multiple merges
	 * have been performed) REFERENCEs that point to the "offending versions".
	 *
	 * To complete the merge process, the client calls doneMerge(Version v)
	 * passing the version object referred to be the jcr:mergeFailed property
	 * that the client wishes to connect to this node in the version graph. This
	 * has the effect of moving the reference to the indicated version from the
	 * jcr:mergeFailed property of this node to the jcr:predecessors.
	 *
	 * If the client chooses not to connect this node to a particular version
	 * referenced in the jcr:mergeFailed property, he calls cancelMerge(String, Version).
	 * This has the effect of removing the reference to the specified version
	 * from jcr:mergeFailed without adding it to jcr:predecessors.
	 *
	 * Once the last reference in jcr:mergeFailed has been either moved to
	 * jcr:predecessors (with doneMerge) or just removed from jcr:mergeFailed
	 * (with cancelMerge) the jcr:mergeFailed property is automatically removed,
	 * thus enabling this node to be checked-in, creating a new version (note
	 * that before the jcr:mergeFailed is removed, its OnParentVersion setting of
